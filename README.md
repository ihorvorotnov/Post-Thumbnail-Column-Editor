# Post Thumbnail Column Editor

A lightweight WordPress plugin to manage your post and custom post type thumbnails from post listing screen.

**Work in progress**.

## To do

- ~~Add post thumbnail column to post list screen using image dashicon instead of text~~
- ~~Add content for this column using dashicons~~
	- ~~If there's a post thumbnail - show "edit" icon~~
	- ~~If there's no post thumbnail - show "add" icon~~
- Move post thumbnail column to beginning (before post title)
- Add clickable actions (try to utilize native WP functions and pop-up, much like on the post edit page)
	- "view / edit" if there's a post thumbnail
	- "add" if there's no post thumbnail
- Make those actions actually save any changes (add or replace post thumbnail)
- Add screenshots
- Review the `readme.txt` for WP.org plugin repository
