== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Will it work with custom post type?**

Yes, as long as your CPT was registered with post thumbnail support.

**Will it work on WordPress Multisite install?**

Yep. It was actually developed under multisite install.

**I can\'t see post thumbnails in listing***

Check your screen settings. And note - you will not see the thumbs itself, this plugin adds an icon indicating if post thumbnail was set. To view the image (or assign if it\'s missing) just click the icon.

**What about support or custom feature requests?**

I\'m checking Support Forum here on WordPress.org, but you can also use go to the plugin GitHub repo.
